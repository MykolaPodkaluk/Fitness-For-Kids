  Name: Bicycle in the knee-acidic pose.
  Description: Stand in the knee-acidic pose (brushes under the shoulders, the legs
    are bent at an angle of 90*). The back is neutral, the look directed down. In
    a circle, stretch your knee to your elbow of the same name (simulate the movements
    of the cyclist) so that the foot does not rise above the parallel with the knee.
    First, perform one foot, then on the other. Don't bend your back. Mach is performed
    by the strength of the gluteal muscles. Breathing is arbitrary.
