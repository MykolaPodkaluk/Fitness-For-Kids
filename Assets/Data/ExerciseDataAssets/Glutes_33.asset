  Name: Swing with a bent leg in the knee-oxygen pose.
  Description: Stand in the knee-acidic pose (brushes under the shoulders, the legs
    are bent at an angle of 90*). The back is neutral, the look directed down. Exhaled,
    take the bent in the knee, leg back and up to the parallel with the floor (do
    the waist). Imagine as if you are pushing something. Inhaling, lower on the knee.
    First, perform one foot, then on the other. Don't bend your back. Mach is performed
    by the strength of the gluteal muscles.
