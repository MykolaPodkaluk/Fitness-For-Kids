  Name: Tell on the curbstone
  Description: Get straight, face to the curbstone. Rise to the curbstone (ottoman,
    cube, individually picking up the height of this support) alternately stepping
    up with each leg, highly lifting Bedro. Help active swinging of your hands. Completely
    step on the feet on the resistance so that the heel does not hang. The back is
    flat, the look directed forward. Stands up. Make sure that the leg that first
    stepped on the curbstone is the first to come on the floor. Try to climb at the
    expense of the gluteal muscles and muscles of Biceps Bedar.
