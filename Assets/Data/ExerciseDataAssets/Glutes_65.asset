  Name: Crane with hip drainage
  Description: Get up exactly one leg, keep 3 points of support. The knee of the
    support leg is slightly bent, the back is flat. They lean forward (due to the
    hip joint, as much as possible to keep the back left), stretching with your arms
    forward, free leg back. Hold in the "stretched bow" position, start turning the
    pelvis with a support leg, as if you were opening a book. At this point, the
    buttock of the support leg is actively working. Try not to put a free foot on
    the support. Repeat is the other leg.
